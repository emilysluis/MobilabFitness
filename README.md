# MobilabFitness
Mobile Fitness Tracking App Project.
April 3, 2019

This repository was created by Emily Sluis for an internship/co-op work term at Mobilab at Thomas More University 
of Applied Science in Geel, Belgium. The project will be continued by future internship students to Mobilab. To learn more

The goal of this project is to develop a fitness tracking app that is accessible to people in wheelchairs due to 
spinal injuries and paralysis.
